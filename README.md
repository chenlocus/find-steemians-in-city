This program is to  facilitate  the same city meet up in steemit.  The program is using node.js with mssql database module.  Thanks for steemsql interface,  I used this to obtain steemians in a specified city.  However, not all people in your city can be found since some of them may not update their profiles in steemit. So if you want to be found by others,  you can go to 'settings' and put your city in 'LOCATION'.


To make use of this program or contribute to extend its functionalities,  you can download from this link:

https://github.com/chenlocus/find-steemians-in-city

Install the latest node.js version in your computer.

Unzip the downloaded package, then go to the fold and put this in your command:

node app



Open up a browser in your computer or any other PC,  and enter this if you open the browser in the same PC as the node.js is running:

127.0.0.1:8888

or if you open  up browser in a different PC,  e.g. the node.js is running in a computer with IP address 172.17.0.138, you should enter this in browser:

172.17.0.138:8888

input the city in the search edit box, then click 'search', you can find registered steemians in that city:
